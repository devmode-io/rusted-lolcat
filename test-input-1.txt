Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, 
run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages. 
Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate 
many classes of bugs at compile-time. Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages,
and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion 
and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. 
Software you know and love, like Firefox, Dropbox, and Cloudflare, uses Rust. From startups to large corporations, from embedded 
devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.
